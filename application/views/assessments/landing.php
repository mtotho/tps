	<h3>Why assess team performance?</h3> 
	<img id="img_landing_graphs" src="<?php echo URL ?>public/images/assessments/landing_graphs.png" /> 
	<p>Assessing team performance has many benefits. Assessments help teams gauge how they are doing against those practices and behaviors that contribute strongly to high team performance. In addition, assessment reports along with facilitated discussions can help a team pinpoint specific actions to improve its effectiveness. Further, by establishing a baseline measure, a team can then conduct follow up assessments periodically to measure progress and fine-tune its performance.</p>
	      
	<p>The team assessments listed in this tab have been carefully researched. They are based on rigorous, multi-year studies, which uncovered the norms, behaviors and practices that the best teams demonstrate. You can use these assessments as a basis for developing your team.</p>
	
	<h3>What criteria do we use to select team assessments?</h3>
	
	<p>All assessments are not created equal. We believe it is very important to assess the rigor with which a team assessment instrument has been created. The results of a poorly designed survey may not be accurate and are difficult to interpret correctly, thus, increasing the probability effort will be focused in unproductive areas; will not resonate with recipients of the feedback, thus making it more difficult for them to accept the data; and do not provide clarity concerning what action to take to improve. We look at serveral factors when evaluating team assessments instrument, such as: Validity, Reliability, Question Wording and Psychometric Analysis.
