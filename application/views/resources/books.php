		<div class="book_description_content">	
			<p>Intelligence professionals are commonly viewed as solo operators. But these
		    days intelligence work is mostly about collaboration. Interdisciplinary and even
		    inter-organizational teams are necessary to solve the really hard problems
		    intelligence professionals face. Tragically, these teams often devolve into wheel-
		    spinning, contentious assemblies that get nothing done. Or members may
		    disengage from a team if they find its work frustrating, trivial, or a waste of their
		    time. Even teams with a spirit of camaraderie may take actions that are flat-out
		    wrong.
		    <br /><br />
		    But there is also good news. This book draws on recent research findings
		    as well as Harvard Professor Richard Hackman’s own experience as an
		    intelligence community researcher and advisor to show how leaders can create
		    
		    an environment where teamwork flourishes. Hackman identifies six enabling
		    conditions – such as establishing clear norms of conduct and providing well-
		    timed team coaching – that increase the likelihood that teams will be effective
		    in any setting or type of organization.. Although written explicitly for intelligence,
		    defense, crisis management, and law enforcement professionals it will also be
		    valuable for improving team success in all kinds of leadership, management,
		    service, and production teams in business, government, and nonprofit
		    enterprises.

    <h5 class="summaries"><u>Leading Teams: Setting the Stage for Great Performances</u> (2002) J. Richard Hackman</h5>
    <div class="book_description">

		<div class="book_description_content">	
	<p>Teams have more talent and experience, more diverse resources, and greater
    operating flexibility than individual performers. So why do so many teams either
    struggle unpleasantly toward an unsatisfactory conclusion - or, worse, crash and
    burn shortly after launch? J. Richard Hackman, one of the world&apos;s leading
    experts on group and organizational behavior, argues that the answer to this
    puzzle is rooted in flawed thinking about team leadership. It is not a leader's
    management style that determines how well a team performs, but how well a
    leader designs and supports a team so that members can manage themselves.
    According to Hackman, cookie-cutter formulas and prescribed leadership styles
    often backfire because they place far too much emphasis on the leader as the
    primary cause of team behavior. In "Leading Teams", he identifies the key
    conditions that any leader can put in place to increase the likelihood of team
    success - regardless of his or her personality or preferred style of operating.
    Through extensive research and compelling examples ranging from orchestras
    to economic analysts to airline cockpit crews, Hackman identifies five conditions
    that set the stage for great performances: a real team, a compelling direction, an
    enabling team structure, a supportive organizational context, and the availability
    of competent coaching. "Leading Teams" outlines what leaders can do to
    structure, support, and guide teams in a way that enhances the social processes
    essential to collective work; builds shared commitment, skills, and task -
    appropriate coordination strategies; helps members troubleshoot problems and
    spot emerging opportunities; and captures experiences and translates them into
    shared knowledge. Out of these conditions, Hackman argues, the very best
    teams emerge - teams that exceed client expectations, grow in capability over
    time, and contribute to the learning and personal fulfillment of individual
    members. Authoritative, practical, and astutely realistic, "Leading Teams" offers
    a new and provocative way of thinking about and leading work teams in any
    organizational setting.

		<div class="book_description_content">	
	<p>An organization&apos;s fate hinges on its CEO--right? Not according to the authors
of Senior Leadership Teams. They argue that in today's world of neck-
snapping change, demands on leaders in top roles are rapidly outdistancing the
capabilities of any one person--no matter how talented. Result? Chief executives
are turning to their enterprise's senior leaders for help.<br /><br />
Yet many CEOs stumble when creating a leadership team. One major challenge
is that senior executives often focus more on their individual roles than on the top
team's shared work. Without the CEO&apos;s careful attention to setting the team up
correctly, these high-powered managers often have difficulty pulling together to
move their organization forward. Sometimes they don&apos;t even agree about what
constitutes the right path forward.<br /><br />
The authors explain how to determine whether your organization needs a senior
leadership team. Then, drawing on their study of 100+ top teams from around
the world, they explain how to create a clear and compelling purpose for your
team, get the right people on it, provide structure and support, and sharpen team
members&apos; competencies--and your own.<br /><br />
This book enables you to create and sustain a leadership team whose members
learn from one another while collaborating to pursue your company&apos;s objectives.

William G. Dyer, Jeffrey H. Dyer</h5>

		<div class="book_description_content">	
	<p>This book contains the concepts, ideas, and practical suggestions that are

of a committee, team, task-force, or any other activity involving collaboration
among several people. The ideas are proven by several decades of experience
and well-supported in the text with numerous examples. It demonstrates that the
business context requires increased teamwork; that the composition of teams
must adapt to local and visible as well as global and virtual settings; that the
competencies and tools for effective teams can be delineated and mastered; and
that temporary, alliance, and virtual teams can change the way we think about
organizations. Solid theory is combined with the most practical of techniques.</p>

	<div class="book_description">
		<a class="book_description_expand"><span>[+]</span> click to expand description</a>
		<div class="book_description_content">	
	<p>The authors, who are both consultants, conducted extensive interviews with companies to discover how successful teams are created and sustained. The result is not a research report but a collection of mini case histories and commentary. Some of the findings: Teams respond to performance challenges and not to managers&apos; exhortations for more &quot;teamwork.&quot; Organizations committed to high-performance standards and willing to modify individual accountability requirements experience the greatest success with teams. Successful team leaders are not necessarily those with remarkable leadership qualities. Instead, they &quot;simply need to believe in their purpose and their people.&quot; Team leaders do real work, remove obstacles, and build trust and confidence. </p>
