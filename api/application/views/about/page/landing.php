	<h2>TPS History</h2>
    <p><img id="img_history" src="<?php echo site_url("public/images/about/imgTPShistory.png") ?>" alt="tps history" />Improving &quot;teamwork and collaboration&quot; is a strategic objective for many companies. For a number of reasons the founders of Team Performance Solutions were disappointed in the search to find concrete, actionable information that could be used to develop teams in organizations.  As a result, the founders decided to conduct a number of studies over multiple years to determine what distinguishes the highest performing teams from the average &#8212; those specific behaviors and practices that make the greatest difference. These studies provided concrete insights that proved extremely valuable for developing high-performing teams.  The founders decided to create Team Performance Solutions to share their insights and collect proven insights, tools, and assessments from others.  Creating high-performing teams is becoming ever more critical to the success of organizations and the founders felt it was time to create one place people could go for reliable information.</p>
