<h4>What criteria do we use to select team assessments?</h4>

<p>
	All team assessments are not created equal. We believe it is very important to assess the rigor with which a team assessment instrument has been created. The results of a poorly designed survey may not be accurate and are difficult to interpret correctly, thus, increasing the probability effort will be focused in unproductive areas; will not resonate with recipients of the feedback, thus making it more difficult for them to accept the data; and do not provide clarity concerning what action to take to improve. We look at serveral factors when evaluating team assessments instrument, such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Validity </span>there are many types of validity; however, an important one is whether the instrument measures what has been shown through research to produce the outcomes it promises. This is important because when you use the results to provide feedback, you want a team to improve.  If the instrument is not valid, it may not produce performance improvements.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Reliability - </span>one form of reliability is called internal consistency.  The constructs measured by a team survey are complex; thus, they must be measured by multiple questions.  Because all questions measuring a particular construct should be answered similarly, we look for measures of internal consistency.  This is important because if the internal consistency is low, it indicates that the questions are not all measuring the intended construct.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Question Wording - </span>the wording of questions is key. Poorly worded questions may be hard to interpret. We check the process by which the questions in a survey were derived.  Well-designed surveys usually go through multiple iterations based on psychometric analysis and feedback. Poorly worded questions are difficult to act on when trying to understand the feedback; thus, making it more difficult to act on the feedback.  Poorly worded items may also create scores that are not a true representation of a team&apos;s performance.  This means the results will not resonate with the team and that will make it harder for them to accept the results.

	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Psychometric Analysis  - </span>this refers to many possible analyses that demonstrate the quality of an instrument. Some additional analyses that we look for are: (1) the percentage of missing items; too many missing items typically means the question is asking about something that people do not have the ability to assess. (2) Evidence that the questions measuring a particular construct are distinct from questions measuring other constructs.  This is important because if the measures are not distinct, interpreting and using the results properly is very difficult. (3) Finally, we want to see evidence that the responses for a particular measure are not overly skewed.  This is important because if all the responses fall at one end of the scale, there is very little information provided by the measure.
