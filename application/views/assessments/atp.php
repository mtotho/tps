			<h3>Accelerating Performance: <span>Team Surveys</span></h3>

			<p>The expanded model to the left depicts the results of a multi-method, multi-year team research study. This study revealed that high performance requires four ingredients:</p>

			<ul id="topList">

	            <li>A partnership and clear accountability among the team&apos;s leader, members and management</li>

	            <li>A balance between what needs to get done and how team members work together</li>

	            <li>Twelve distinct team leader and team member behaviors or drivers</li>

	            <li>Two senior management enablers that contribute to high team performance</li>

	            

	        </ul>

        	<p>All twelve factors, the two enablers and the four key outcomes are all measured in the Team Survey. In addition, we offer a Stakeholder Survey. This survey contains a subset of questions from the Team Survey that are visible to a team&apos;s external stakeholders.  The two surveys together provide the clearest view of how a team is currently performing. </p>
